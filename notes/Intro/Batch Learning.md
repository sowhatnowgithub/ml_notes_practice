Batch is the offline learing.
Online is the server-side learning.

Batch Learning -
	We use complete data to train our model, we use a lot of data, then we will deploy it on the server.

Static Model - once u train the model, then it will use that model, It is not updated.

Since data is huge we handle the data in offline and reupdate it and then reupload in the server.

Disadvantages of the offline model
1.Lots of Data
2.Hardware Limitation 
3.Avaliability
