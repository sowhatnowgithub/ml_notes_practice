1.  Data Collection  
    This is the important part of ml, model development  
    It is mainly done by API and Web Scraping
    
2.  Insufficient Data/Labelled Data  
    We need reliable data and understanding this is most important aspect of designing ml algorithm  
    If u have huge amount of data, algorithm doesn't matter.  
    But having such amount of data is not feasable for everyone.
    

3.Non Representative Data  
In a machine learning model, designing if we have only part of data, this tells us only half of the story, not the completer story as we lack the data to tell us.  
Issues :  
Sampling Noise,  
Sampling Bias

4. Poor Quality Data leads to poor model development

5.Irrelevant Features
	"Garbage In Garbage Out" - this is the principle of ML, Providing relevant features for a predictins is important.

6. OverFitting
	This gives good results for training data, when new data is given it fails.
	Our model depends on the data given, any new data given is considered the same without knowing everything as the previous trained data.

7.Under Fitting
	It might not give good results even for trainig model.
	
8.Software Integration
	End-to-End Projects, are  the most important, which makes our ml model have an impact on the world.

9.Offline Learning/ Deployment

10.Cost Involved


## The best way to use ml is to create a end-to-end project of an ml and deploy in server and let others use it.
