Training Set -> learning algorithm -> h(hypothesis)
Regression is for continous value.
### Designing a learning algorithm 
how to represent h?
How many input features ?
X1,X2 ..... are the features.
h(x)=Theta(0)+theta(x1)+Theta(x2)+....
h(x)=sumation(Theta(j)X(j))
Where X(0)=1
Theta = matrix(Theta(0),....)(column matrix)
X = matrix(X(0),......)(column matrix)

Theta = "Parameters"
m = # training examples(rows in table above)
X = "inputs"/features
Y = output/target variable
(X,Y) = Training Example

(X^(i),Y^(i)) = ith target example

So, X(1)^(2) = represents First column and Second row

How do we chose parameters?(Theta)
